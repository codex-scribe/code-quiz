# code-quiz
This markup will serve as a guide for how we want to structure our programming logic for our web app. Topics are free to be added and removed as we revise our wireframe and MVP functionality. 

## To play
To play the quiz, click the start button (labeled Go!) and answer the questions.
A timer will begin counting down.  If you answer correctly, the page will go on to the next question.
If you don't answer correctly, 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer, then it will go to the next question.




## High score
When you reach the end, your score will be recorded as the time remaining in the timer.  Enter your initials and click submit, and 
your score will be recorded and displayed in a table!  If you want to play again, you may do so, and subsequent stores will also be saved.
